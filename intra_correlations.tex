\multicolumn{2}{p{10cm}}{The intra-class correlation coefficient gives the proportion of the overall variance that is explained by within class variance. An intra-class correlation of 1 means the variable is the same for everyone in the class. An intra-class correlation of 0 means the variable is no more similar within the class than in different classes. Here the classes are the enumeration areas } \\
