\multicolumn{5}{p{13cm}}{ Instruments were distance and cost to nearest mobile money agent and their interactions with the shock variable. All regressions include full set of household control variables from Table \ref{HH sum}. All regressions also control for village characteristics which could affect the ease of sending remittances. These are the distance to the nearest main road, distance to nearest population centre and distance to nearest market, as well as having an ATM, bank or post office in the village. Village MM use refers to the proportion of households in the village using mobile money. Mobile money use is a dummy variable equal to one if that household uses mobile money. }\\
