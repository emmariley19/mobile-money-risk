\multicolumn{3}{p{14cm}}{Average marginal effects from logit regressions of mobile money use and mobile money agent access. Regression 1 has errors clustered at the village level and covariates are at the household level . Regression 2 is run at the village level, with village level averages of the household covariates and also includes village level characteristics which could affect an agent's decision on whether to locate there. These are shown in appendix \ref{appen_vill}} \\
